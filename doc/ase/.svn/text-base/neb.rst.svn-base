   :synopsis: Nudged Elastic Band method.

.. default-role:: math

The Nudged Elastic Band method is a technique for finding transition paths
(and corresponding energy barriers) between given initial and final states.
The method involves constructing a "chain" of "replicas" or "images" of the
system and relaxing them in a certain way.

The NEB class
=============

This module defines one class:

.. class:: NEB(images, k=0.1, climb=False)

Example of use::

  # Read initial and final states:
  initial = read('A.traj')
  final = read('B.traj')
  # Make a band consisting of 5 images:
  images = [initial]
  images += [initial.copy() for i in range(3)]
  images += [final]
  neb = NEB(images)
  # Interpolate linearly the potisions of the three middle images:
  neb.interpolate()
  # Set calculators:
  for image in images[1:4]:
      image.set_calculator(MyCalculator(...))
  # Optimize:
  optimizer = QuasiNewton(neb, trajectory='A2B.traj')
  optimizer.run(fmax=0.04)

Notice the use of the :meth:`~NEB.interpolate` method to get a good
initial guess for the path from A to B.

.. method:: NEB.interpolate()

   Interpolate path linearly from initial to final state.

Note also that only the internal images (not the endpoints) need have
calculators attached.

.. note::

  If there are `M` images and each image has `N` atoms, then the NEB
  object behaves like one big Atoms object with `MN` atoms, so its
  :meth:`get_positions` method will return a `MN \times 3` array.


Trajectories
============

The line::

  optimizer = QuasiNewton(neb, trajectory='A2B.traj')

will write all images to one file.  The Trajector object knows about
NEB calculations, so it will write `M` images with `N` atoms at every
iteration and not one big configuration containing `MN` atoms.

The result of the latest iteration can now be analysed with this
command: :command:`ag A2B.traj@-5:`.

For the example above, you can write the images to individual
trajectory files like this::

  for i in range(1, 4):
      qn.attach(PickleTrajectory('A2B-%d.traj' % d, 'w', images[i])

The result of the latest iteration can be analysed like this:

.. highlight:: bash

::

  $ ag A.traj A2B-?.traj B.traj -n -1 

.. highlight:: python


Restarting
==========

Restart the calculation like this::

  images = read('A2B.traj@-5:')



Climbing image
==============

The "climbing image" variation involves designating a specific image to behave
differently to the rest of the chain: it feels no spring forces, and the
component of the potential force parallel to the chain is reversed, such that
it moves towards the saddle point. This depends on the adjacent images
providing a reasonably good approximation of the correct tangent at the
location of the climbing image; thus in general the climbing image is not
turned on until some iterations have been run without it (generally 20% to 50%
of the total number of iterations).

To use the climbing image NEB method, instantiate the NEB object like this::

  neb = NEB(images, climb=True)


Parallelization over images
===========================

Some calculators can parallelize over the images of a NEB calculation.
The script will have to be run with an MPI-enabled Python interpreter
like GPAW_'s gpaw-python_.  All images exist on all processors, but
only some of them have a calculator attached::

  from ase.parallel import rank, size
  # Number of internal images:
  n = len(images) - 2
  j = rank * n // size
  for i, image in enumerate(images[1:-1]):
      if i == j:
          image.set_calculator(EMT())

Create the NEB object with ``NEB(images, parallel=True)`` and let the
master processes write the images::

  if rank % (size // n) == 0:
      traj = PickleTrajectory('neb%d.traj' % j, 'w', images[1 + j],
                              master=True)
      optimizer.attach(traj)
