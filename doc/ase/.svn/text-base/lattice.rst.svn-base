Setting up crystals and surfaces
================================

.. default-role:: math



Easy setup of surfaces
======================

.. module:: lattice.surface

A number of utility functions are provided to set up
the most common surfaces, to add vacuum layers, and to add adsorbates
to a surface.  In general, all surfaces can be set up with
the `general crystal structures`_ modules documented below, but these
utility functions make common tasks easier.



Example
-------

To setup an Al(111) surface with a hydrogen atom adsorbed in an on-top
position::

  from ase.lattice.surface import *
  slab = fcc111('Al', size=(2,2,3), vacuum=10.0)
  add_adsorbate(slab, 'H', 1.5, 'ontop')

This will produce a slab 2x2x3 times the minimal possible size, with a
(111) surface in the z direction.  A 10 Å vacuum layer is added,
and a hydrogen atom is adsorbed in an on-top position 1.5 Å above the
top layer.

The atoms in the slab will have tags set to the layer number: First layer
atoms will have tag=1, second layer atoms will have tag=2, and so on.
Addsorbates get tag=0:

>>> print atoms.get_tags()
[3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0]

This can be useful for setting up :mod:`constraints` (see
:ref:`diffusion_tutorial`).


Utility functions for setting up surfaces
-----------------------------------------

All the functions setting up surfaces take the same arguments.

*symbol*:
  The chemical symbol of the element to use.

*size*:
  A tuple giving the system size in units of the minimal unit cell.

*a*: 
  (optional) The lattice constant.  If specified, it overrides the
  expermental lattice constant of the element.  Must be specified if
  setting up a crystal structure different from the one found in
  nature.

*c*: 
  (optional) Extra HCP lattice constant.  If specified, it overrides the
  expermental lattice constant of the element.  Can be specified if
  setting up a crystal structure different from the one found in
  nature and an ideal `c/a` ratio is not wanted (`c/a=(8/3)^{1/3}`).

*vacuum*:
  The thickness of the vacuum layer.  Default value is zero.

*orthogonal*:
  (optional, not supported by all functions). If specified and true,
  forces the creation of a unit cell with orthogonal basis vectors.
  If the default is such a unit cell, this argument is not supported.

Each function defines a number of standard adsorbtion sites that can
later be used when adding an adsorbate with
:func:`lattice.surface.add_adsorbate`.


The following functions are provided
````````````````````````````````````

.. function:: fcc100(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0)
.. function:: fcc110(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0)
.. function:: bcc100(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0)

These allways give orthorhombic cells:

======  ========
fcc100  |fcc100|
fcc110  |fcc110|
bcc100  |bcc100|
======  ========


.. function:: fcc111(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0, orthogonal=False)
.. function:: bcc110(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0, orthogonal=False)
.. function:: bcc111(symbol, size, a=None, vacuum=0.0, orthogonal=False)
.. function:: hcp0001(symbol, size, a=None, c=None, vacuum=0.0, orthogonal=False)

These can give both non-orthorhombic and orthorhombic cells:

=======  =========  ==========
fcc111   |fcc111|   |fcc111o|
bcc110   |bcc110|   |bcc110o|
bcc111   |bcc111|   |bcc111o|
hcp0001  |hcp0001|  |hcp0001o|
=======  =========  ==========

The adsorption sites are marked with:

=======  ========  =====  =====  ========  ===========  ==========

Adding new utility functions
````````````````````````````

If you need other surfaces than the ones above, the easiest is to look
in the source file surface.py, and adapt one of the existing
functions.  *Please* contribute any such function that you make
either by cheking it into SVN or by mailing it to the developers.

Adding adsorbates
-----------------

After a slab has been created, a vacuum layer can be added.  It is
also possible to add one or more adsorbates.

.. autofunction:: ase.lattice.surface.add_adsorbate


Centering the system
--------------------

The slabs are typically set up with vacuum on one side only.  For GPAW
calculations with free boundary conditions perpendicular to the
surface, the vacuum should be distributed on both sides.  This can be
done by centering the system in the unit cell using the
:meth:`~ase.atoms.Atoms.center()` method of the atoms.



General crystal structures
==========================

.. module:: lattice

Modules for creating crystal structures are found in the module
:mod:`lattice`.  Most Bravais lattices are implemented, as
are a few important lattices with a basis.  The modules can create
lattices with any orientation (see below).  These modules can be used
to create surfaces with any crystal structure and any orientation by
later adding a vacuum layer with :func:`lattice.surface.add_vacuum`.

Example
-------

To set up a slab of FCC copper with the [1,-1,0] direction along the
x-axis, [1,1,-2] along the y-axis and [1,1,1] along the z-axis, use::

  from ase.lattice.cubic import FaceCenteredCubic
  atoms = FaceCenteredCubic(directions=[[1,-1,0], [1,1,-2], [1,1,1]],
                            size=(2,2,3), symbol='Cu', pbc=(1,1,0))

The minimal unit cell is repeated 2*2*3 times.  The lattice constant
is taken from the database of lattice constants in :mod:`data` module.
There are periodic boundary conditions along the *x* and *y* axis, but
free boundary conditions along the *z* axis. Since the three directions
are perpendicular, a (111) surface is created.

To set up a slab of BCC copper with [100] along the first axis, [010]
along the second axis, and [111] along the third axis use::

  from ase.lattice.cubic import BodyCenteredCubic
  atoms = BodyCenteredCubic(directions=[[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]],
                            size=(2,2,3), symbol='Cu', pbc=(1,1,0),
			    latticeconstant=4.0)

Since BCC is not the natural crystal structure for Cu, a lattice
constant has to be specified.  Note that since the repeat directions
of the unit cell are not orthogonal, the Miller indices of the
surfaces will *not* be the same as the Miller indices of the axes.
The indices of the surfaces in this example will be (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1)
and (0,0,1).

Usage
-----

The lattice objects are called with a number of arguments specifying
e.g. the size and orientation of the lattice.  All arguments should be
given as named arguments.


``directions`` and/or ``miller``: 
  Specifies the orientation of the
  lattice as the Miller indices of the three basis vectors of the
  supercell (``directions=...``) and/or as the Miller indices of the
  three surfaces (``miller=...``).  Normally, one will specify either
  three directions or three surfaces, but any combination that is both
  complete and consistent is allowed, e.g. two directions and two
  surface miller indices (this example is slightly redundant, and
  consistency will be checked).  If only some directions/miller
  indices are specified, the remaining should be given as ``None``.
  If you intend to generate a specific surface, and prefer to specify
  the miller indices of the unit cell basis (``directions=...``), it
  is a good idea to give the desired Miller index of the surface as
  well to allow the module to test for consistency.  Example:

  >>> atoms = BodyCenteredCubic(directions=[[1,-1,0],[1,1,-1],[0,0,1]],
  ...                           miller=[None, None, [1,1,2]], ...)                              
``size``:
  A tuple of three numbers, defining how many times the fundamental
  repeat unit is repeated. Default: (1,1,1).  Be aware that if
  high-index directions are specified, the fundamental repeat unit may
  be large.


``symbol``
  The element, specified by the atomic number (an integer) or by the
  atomic symbol (i.e. 'Au').  For compounds, a tuple or list of
  elements should be given.

``latticeconstant``:
  The lattice constant.  If no lattice constant is
  specified, one is extracted from ASE.ChemicalElements provided that
  the element actually has the crystal structure you are creating.
  Depending on the crystal structure, there will be more than one
  lattice constant, and they are specified by giving a dictionary or a
  tuple (a scalar for cubic lattices).  Distances are given in
  Angstrom, angles in degrees. 

  =============  ===================  ========================================
  Structure      Lattice constants    Dictionary-keys
  =============  ===================  ========================================
  Cubic          a                    'a'
  Tetragonal     (a, c)               'a', 'c' or 'c/a'
  Orthorhombic   (a, b, c)            'a', 'b' or 'b/a', 'c' or 'c/a'
  Triclinic      (a, b, c, `\alpha`,  'a', 'b' or 'b/a', 'c' or
                 `\beta`, `\gamma`)   'c/a', 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma'
  Monoclinic     (a, b, c, alpha)     'a', 'b' or 'b/a', 'c' or 'c/a', 'alpha'
  Hexagonal      (a, c)               'a', 'c' or 'c/a'
  =============  ===================  ========================================
  
  Example:

  >>> atoms = Monoclinic( ... , latticeconstant={'a':3.06, 
  ...     'b/a': 0.95, 'c/a': 1.07, 'alpha'=74})


``debug``:
  Controls the amount of information printed.  0: no info is printed.
  1 (the default): The indices of surfaces and unit cell vectors are
  printed.  2: Debugging info is printed.


Defining new lattices
---------------------

Often, there is a need for new lattices - either because an element
crystallizes in a lattice that is not a simple Bravais lattice, or
because you need to work with a compound or an ordered alloy.

All the lattice generating objects are instances of a class, you
generate new lattices by deriving a new class and instantiating it.
This is best explained by an example.  The diamond lattice is two
interlacing FCC lattices, so it can be seen as a face-centered cubic
lattice with a two-atom basis.  The Diamond object could be defined like
this::

  from ase.lattice.cubic import FaceCenteredCubicFactory
  class DiamondFactory(FaceCenteredCubicFactory):
      """A factory for creating diamond lattices."""
      xtal_name = 'diamond'
      bravais_basis = [[0, 0, 0], [0.25, 0.25, 0.25]]
    
  Diamond = DiamondFactory()



Lattices with more than one element
```````````````````````````````````

Lattices with more than one element is made in the same way.  A new
attribute, ``element_basis``, is added, giving which atoms in the
basis are which element.  If there are four atoms in the basis, and
element_basis is (0,0,1,0), then the first, second and fourth atoms
are one element, and the third is the other element.  As an example,
the AuCu3 structure (also known as `\mathrm{L}1_2`) is defined as::

  # The L1_2 structure is "based on FCC", but is really simple cubic
  # with a basis.
  class AuCu3Factory(SimpleCubicFactory):
      "A factory for creating AuCu3 (L1_2) lattices."
      bravais_basis = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0]]
      element_basis = (0, 1, 1, 1)

  AuCu3 = L1_2 = AuCu3Factory()

Sometimes, more than one crystal structure can be used to define the
crystal structure, for example the Rocksalt structure is two
interpenetrating FCC lattices, one with one kind of atoms and one with
another.  It would be tempting to define it as

::

  class NaClFactory(FaceCenteredCubicFactory):
      "A factory for creating NaCl (B1, Rocksalt) lattices."

      bravais_basis = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]
      element_basis = (0, 1)


  B1 = NaCl = Rocksalt = NaClFactory()

but if this is used to define a finite system, one surface would be
covered with one type of atoms, and the opposite surface with the
other.  To maintain the stochiometry of the surfaces, it is better to
use the simple cubic lattice with a larger basis::

  # To prevent a layer of element one on one side, and a layer of
  # element two on the other side, NaCl is based on SimpleCubic instead
  # of on FaceCenteredCubic
  class NaClFactory(SimpleCubicFactory):
      "A factory for creating NaCl (B1, Rocksalt) lattices."

      bravais_basis = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0.5], [0, 0.5, 0], [0, 0.5, 0.5],
		       [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 0, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0],
		       [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]
      element_basis = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)


  B1 = NaCl = Rocksalt = NaClFactory()
