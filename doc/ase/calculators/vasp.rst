Introduction
============

VASP_ is a density-functional theory code using pseudopotentials or 
the projector-augmented wave method and a plane wave basis set. This 
interface makes it possible to use VASP_ as a calculator in ASE, and 
also to use ASE as a post-processor for an already performed VASP_
calculation.

Environment variables
=====================

You need to write a script called :file:`run_vasp.py` containing
something like this::

  import os
  exitcode = os.system('vasp')

The environment variable :envvar:`VASP_SCRIPT` must point to that file.

A directory containing the pseudopotential directories :file:`potpaw` 
(LDA XC) :file:`potpaw_GGA` (PW91 XC) and :file:`potpaw_PBE` (PBE XC)
is also needed, and it is to be put in the environment variable
:envvar:`VASP_PP_PATH`.

Set both environment variables in your shell configuration file:

.. highlight:: bash
 
::

  $ export VASP_SCRIPT=$HOME/vasp/run_vasp.py
  $ export VASP_PP_PATH=$HOME/vasp/mypps

.. highlight:: python



VASP Calculator
=============== 

The default setting used by the VASP interface is

.. class:: Vasp(restart=None, xc='PW91', setups=None, kpts=(1,1,1), gamma=None)

Below follows a list with a selection of parameters

==============  =========  ==============  ============================

                                           SC-iterations
==============  =========  ==============  ============================

*seq*: A sequence of three ``int``'s.

For parameters in the list without default value given, VASP will set 
the default value. Most of the parameters used in the VASP :file:`INCAR` file 
are allowed keywords. See the official `VASP manual`_ for more details.

.. _VASP manual: http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/vasp.html


.. note:: 
   
   Parameters can be changed after the calculator has been constructed
   by using the :meth:`~ase.calculators.vasp.Vasp.set` method:

   >>> calc.set(prec='Accurate', ediff=1E-5)

   This would set the precision to Accurate and the break condition for 
   the electronic SC-loop to ``1E-5`` eV.


Spin-polarized calculation
==========================

If the atoms object has non-zero magnetic moments, a spin-polarized calculation
will be performed by default.

Here follows an example how to calculate the total magnetic moment of a sodium
chloride molecule.
  
.. literalinclude:: NaCl.py

In this example the initial magnetic moments are assigned to the atoms
when defining the Atoms object. The calculator will detect that at least
one of the atoms has a non-zero magnetic moment and a spin-polarized
calculation will automatically be performed. The ASE generated :file:`INCAR`
file will look like:

.. literalinclude:: INCAR_NaCl


.. note:: 
   
   It is also possible to manually tell the calculator to perform a 
   spin-polarized calculation:

   >>> calc.set(ispin=2)

   This can be useful for continuation jobs, where the initial magnetic 
   moment is read from the WAVECAR file.


Restart old calculation
=======================

To continue an old calculation which has been performed without the interface
use the ``restart`` parameter when constructing the calculator

>>> calc = Vasp(restart=True)

Then the calculator will read atomic positions from the :file:`CONTCAR` file,
physical quantities from the :file:`OUTCAR` file, **k**-points from the
:file:`KPOINTS` file and parameters from the :file:`INCAR` file. 

.. note::

   Only Monkhorst-Pack and \Gamma-centered **k**-point sampling are supported 
   for restart at the moment. Some :file:`INCAR` parameters may not be
   implemented for restart yet. Please report any problems to the ASE mailing
   list.
