==========================
Pure Python EMT calculator
==========================

The EMT potential is included in the ASE package in order to have a
simple calculator that can be used for quick demonstrations and
tests.

.. warning::

   If you want to do a real application using EMT, you should used the
   *much* more efficient implementation in the :class:`ASAP`
   calculator.

.. class:: EMT()

Right now, the only supported elements are: Ni, C, Pt, Ag, H, Al, O,
N, Au, Pd, Cu.
