Siesta 1: Basis Sets
--------------------

This exercise is intended to illustrate the definition of basis sets
with different numbers of orbitals and localization radii in
SIESTA. It is based on the H\ :sub:`2`\ O molecule. You will first use
standard basis sets generated by SIESTA, and then a basis set
specifically optimized for the H\ :sub:`2`\ O molecule. The tips at
the end of this page will help you in analyzing the results of the
calculations.

We are going to use the ASE interface to the :mod:`siesta` calculator,
for the official SIESTA documentation see here_.

Part 1: Standard basis sets
---------------------------

In the following script you will relax the structure of the H\ :sub:`2`\ O
molecule to find its equilibrium structure. 

.. literalinclude:: h2o.py

Run the script using three different basis sets: single-Z (SZ),
double-Z (DZ) and double-Z plus polarization (DZP). Run it in
different directories for each basis set, since the run will produce a
large amount of output files. The bases are defined in the script
through these three lines::

  calc.set_fdf('PAO.BasisSize','SZ')
  calc.set_fdf('PAO.EnergyShift',e_s * eV)
  calc.set_fdf('PAO.SplitNorm',0.15)

For each of the basis sets the script will run the relaxation for
different ``EnergyShift`` parameters. Look at the results as a
function of basis size and localization radius (or energy shift).

In particular, you should look at:

* Total energy
* Bond lenghts at the relaxed structure
* Bond angles at the relaxed structure
* Execution time
* Radius of each of the orbitals
* Shape of the orbitals

The script will print bond lengths and angles, total energy plus the
wall time for each energy shift.  The radii of the orbitals from the
last run can be found in the file ``h2o.txt`` along with miscellaneous
other informations.  Orbital shapes from the last run are stored in
the ``ORB.*`` files, which contain the value of the orbitals
versus radius. (Note that the standard way to plot the orbitals
is to multiply the orbital by :math:`r^l`).


You can visualize both the static atoms and
the relaxation trajectory using the the ASE :mod:`gui`. For example
you can visualize the relaxation trajectory from the command line by
doing::

  $ ag h2o_0.1.traj

Note that you will get a trajectory file ``.traj`` for each energy
shift in the loop.

Try to get plots like the following, obtained for a SZ basis:

|en| |dist| |ang|

.. |en| image:: ener.png
.. |dist| image:: distance.png
.. |ang| image:: angle.png


Try to answer these questions:

1. What is the best basis set that you have found? Why?
2. How do the results compare with experiment?  
3. What do you consider a reasonable basis for the molecule, if you need an accuracy in the geometry of about 1%?  
4. In order to assess convergence with respect to basis set size, should you compare the results with the experimental ones, or with those of a converged basis set calculation?


Part 2: Optimized basis sets
----------------------------

You will now do the same calculations as in Part 1, but now using a
basis set specifically optimized for the H\ :sub:`2`\ O molecule. Use the
following optimized block instead of the basis-definition lines in
Part1::

 calc.set_fdf('PAO.Basis',
                 ["""H     2      0.22
                 n=1    0    2   E      2.07      0.00
                 4.971   1.771
                 1.000   1.000
                 n=2    1    1   E      0.89      0.01
                 4.988
                 1.000
                 O     3     -0.20
                 n=2    0    2   E      0.00      1.31
                 5.000   2.581
                 1.000   1.000
                 n=2    1    2   E      0.00      5.28
                 6.500   2.487
                 1.000   1.000
                 n=3    2    1   E    104.31      0.00
                 3.923
                 1.000"""])

Compare the parameters with those of the calculations in Part 1.

Do the runs with this basis set, and compare the results with the
previous ones.


Tips
----

Tip 1: You can see the radii of the orbitals in the output file, just after the line reading::

  printput: Basis input ----------------------------------------------

Tip 2: You can look at the shape of the orbitals by plotting the contents of the ORB* files generated by SIESTA.

Tip 3: You will find a lot of information on the run in the ``.txt`` output file

Tip 4: In ``ag`` you can select :menuselection:`View --> VMD` to start
the VMD viewer. There you can change the atom representation to what
you feel is more convenient. Do that by selecting
:menuselection:`Graphics --> Representations` in the top bar.

Tip 5: SIESTA will store basis functions in ``ORB.*`` files.  These files can be plotted using the :command:`xmgrace` command on the GBAR like this::

  $ xmgrace ORB.S1.1.O ORB.S2.1.O
